            Hi!
            This is Debosmita on this side. I am the developer of this site!
            It is a work under progress, but I feel like I will be able to complete it soon.
            So, a little bit about myself is that, I am a passionate coder who is learning a lot of technologies. Some of my skillsets include: Python, CPP, front-end developement and Django.
            I am working on learning React.js and Node.js and flutter.
            Thank you for visiting!
        </p>
